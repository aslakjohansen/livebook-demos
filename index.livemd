# Index through Repository Readme

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:kino, "~> 0.12.3"}
])
```

## Introduction

Livebook has some trouble loading links in new tabs. This can be really annoying when you have a repository with several notebooks that you want to open.

Links in markdown code can be opened in new tabs, so I just reuse my repository [README.md](README.md) file:

```elixir
(__DIR__ <> "/README.md")
|> File.read!()
|> Kino.Markdown.new()
```
